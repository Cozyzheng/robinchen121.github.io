- Latex

### Mathematical skills

I have not been in the major of mathematics. However, I have been learning the following books for research.
- *Convex optimization*. &nbsp;&nbsp; Boyd, Stephen, and Lieven Vandenberghe. Cambridge university press, 2004.
- *Introduction to stochastic programming*. &nbsp;&nbsp; Birge, John R., and Francois Louveaux. Springer Science & Business Media, 2011.

### Working papers

1. Add `gem "jekyll-remote-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
3. Add `jekyll-remote-theme` to the list of `plugins` in your `_config.yml` file
4. Add `remote_theme: daviddarnes/alembic` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
6. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### Pulications

_(deprecated, not recommended)_

1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic#fork-destination-box)
2. Replace the `Gemfile` with one stating all the gems used in your project
3. Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: `.github`, `LICENSE`, `screenshot.png`, `CNAME` and `alembic-jekyll-theme.gemspec`
4. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
6. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, simply by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're just looking to set your own colours and fonts copy the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file into your project at the same file path (`_sass/_settings.scss`) and change variables however you wish. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
