This paper is written by Katehakis et al. (2016). Its main difference with Chao et al. (2008) and Gong et al. (2014) is its considering of non-stationary demand.

Inventory-cash state $(x_n, y_n)$, where $x_n$ the initial inventory in period $n$, and $y_n$ denotes the amount of product that can be purchased using all the available cash $\gamma_n$ ($\gamma_n=cy_n$).
