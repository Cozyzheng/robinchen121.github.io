Recently, one of my paper was rejected. I forgot to cite one important paper "Capacitated inventory problems with fixed order costs: some optimal policy structure" in EJOR (2000) by Gallego & Scheller-Wolf. Now I am digging into this paper. 



This paper characterize some features of the optimal ordering policy for the problem --- "capacitated stochastic inventory problem with fixed costs".  It propose a definition  of CK convexity.
