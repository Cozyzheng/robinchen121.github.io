The paper "The infinite horizon periodic review problem with setup costs and capacity constraints: a partial characterization of the optimal policy" published in OR, 2004 is not easy for me to follow.

I am puzzed by the definition of "piecewise concavity". In the paper, it says $g_1(y)=L(y)+cy$ is piecewise concave. However, $L(y)$ is a convex function by assumption. Why this convex function piecewise concave?
