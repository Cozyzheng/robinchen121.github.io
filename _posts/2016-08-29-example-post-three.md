Recently, I am reading the paper "Dynamic Inventory Management with Cash Flow Constraints" from Xiuli Chao, et. al (2008). During the deductions of the proofs by myself,
there is a query that I can not understand.

In the paper, an eqution is defined as follows:
$$
\pi_n(y, R)=E\left\{V_{n+1}\big((y-D)^+, p\min\{y, D_n\}+(1+d)(R-cy)\big)\right\}
$$

However, in the proof for Theorem 2 from its appendix, it wrote:
$$
\pi_n(y, R)=E\left\{\tilde{V}_{n+1}\big((y-D)^+, (p-c)\min\{y, D_n\}+(1+d)R-dcy\big)\right\}
$$


The modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device.
